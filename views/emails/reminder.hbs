{{guestsNames attending=rsvpd}},

We've reserved blocks of rooms at hotels in Easton, MD for guests attending our wedding. These room blocks expire at the end of August, so if you're planning to attend and have not reserved a hotel room, we recommend you do soon.

All the info you'll need to reserve a hotel room is on our website:
http://leslie-eric.us/logistics/hotels/

When booking a reservation it's best to call the hotel and mention it's for the "Verploegen/Ferraiuolo" wedding. Don't worry the hotel staff can't pronounce our last names either :)

We'll see you soon!
